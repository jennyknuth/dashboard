# n.io Intro Lab

The UI that accompanies the nio.school introduction labs.

To build and run locally:
```
npm install
npm start
```

To build a minified version usable for production:
```
npm run build
```

## Deployment

The `master` branch is kept in sync via a Jenkins job with https://nio.school/labtest. All other labs (e.g. `lab1`, `lab2`) are also kept in sync.
