You will be working through four separate n.io school labs to experience and explore the capabilities of n.io.

You will be working through four separate n.io School Labs to experience and explore the capabilities of n.io.

* Lab 1: Get Local Weather via SMS Text
* Lab 2: Shake Phone to Control Fan
* Lab 3: SensorTag controls LED Light
* Lab 4: Shake Phone, Start Fan, Measure Windspeed, Light LED

In the first lab we will use an instance (installation) of n.io running in the cloud. This means n.io isn’t running on any physical computer or micro-controller sitting next to you. For the following three labs, you will be running n.io on the Raspberry Pi micro-controller that came in the kit. Each instance of n.io will have some pre-configured 'services' that we have set up for you to use in conjunction with the services you will configure and make yourself.

Each service running in an instance of n.io will transform the data coming from sensors or APIs into useful information that n.io can then use to control other devices. For example, a service could send you important updates or alerts or send changes to a website.

Each service is composed of blocks. The majority of these blocks take incoming signals, transform or manipulate the data in some way, and then pass the new signal into the next block in the service.

n.io will also be integrated into this website. This is your personal site (**https://nio.school/[your unique lab number]**), and it is set up to respond to signals from the services you create. You will see your results in action. This **https://nio.school** site is another demonstration of how n.io can make integrating devices, signals, and human interactions simple.

We would like to stress the importance of correctly configuring the blocks you will use. Feel free to copy and paste the code snippets from this example into your block configurations to ensure exact syntax. Many times, if data isn’t flowing through services as you expect, it's because something wasn’t capitalized correctly or there is a spelling error somewhere in your configurations.
