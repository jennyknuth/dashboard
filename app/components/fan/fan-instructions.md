In this lab you will build a service that will allow you to shake your phone to toggle the fan on and off. After the service is built, you will be able to see the state of the fan and the shake pattern from the accelerometer on your phone at: `https://nio.school/labtest/lab2`.

#### Hardware Instructions
1. Press the power button on the AT&T Unite Express. Wait for it to turn on fully before moving on to the next step. You will know it is ready when the screen looks similar to: <br>
     ![](./img/instructions/att-express.png)
1. Plug in the microUSB cable to the correct port on the Raspberry Pi and plug the other end into a USB port on your computer to power on the pi [PHOTO OF PI CONNECTED TO COMPUTER]
1. Once the Raspberry Pi turns on, the red LED by the microUSB port should remain solid

#### Designer Instructions
##### Follow the steps below for Lab 2: Shake Phone to Control Fan.

1. Create a new service by clicking the `+ add new service` button
1. Name it `Lab2`

##### Subscribing to the phoneâ€™s shake data
>The Subscriber and Publisher blocks are used to send signals between services. A Publisher block posts signals to a specified `Topic`, while Subscriber blocks listen for those signals and pass them on to their respective services. In this case, the `DetectShake` service is publishing to the `shake` topic. We will configure the Subscriber block by modifying the `Topic` field in the block to pick up the signals from the end of the `DetectShake` service that has been provided for you

1. Click on the **Sub** category on the right side pane of the Designer
1. Drag the `+ Subscriber` template block onto your canvas
1. Name it `SubscribeShake` and click `accept`
>Notice the blue dot in the upper left corner of the block. This means the block has unsaved configuration changes

4. Click the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the block to open the configuration panel
1. Fill in the following configuration fields:
     - **Topic**: `shake`
1. Click `save` at the bottom of the panel

##### Strip signal of everything but acceleration data
>DynamicFields blocks are used to reformat incoming signals that are assigned by the `fields` attribute . If the `Exclude existing fields?` checkbox is checked, previous key:value pairs will be discarded and the block will only pass on the key:value pairs you configure in the configuration panel. If the `Exclude existing fields?` checkbox is not checked, it will combine the key:value pairs you configure with the existing signal

1. Click on the **DF** category on the right side pane of the Designer
1. Drag the `+ Dynamic Fields` template block onto your canvas
1. Name it `GetAccelData` and click `accept`
1. Click the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the block to open the configuration panel
1. Check the `Exclude existing fields?` checkbox
1. Click on the `+` in the `Fields` attribute
1. Fill in the following configuration fields:
     - **Attribute Name**: `accel`
     - **Attribute Value**: `{{ $accel }}`
>Surrounding a value with `{{ }}` will tell n.io to compile the value as Python code. Using a `$` character tells n.io to look at the value matching the specified key from the incoming signal. In this case, the incoming signal has the keys *longitude* and *latitude*, and we want n.io to evaluate the **Attribute Value** field to be the value of the keys

8. Click `save` at the bottom of the panel

##### Publish shake data to fan
1. Click on the **Pub** category on the right side pane of the Designer
1. Drag the `+ Publisher` template block onto your canvas
1. Name it `PublishFan` and click `accept`
1. Click the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the block to open the configuration panel
1. Fill in the following configuration fields:
     - **Topic**: `fan`
6. Click `save` at the bottom of the panel

##### Connecting and running your services
>Signal flow is defined by clicking on the blue circle at the bottom of a block and dragging the connection to the blue circle at the top of the appropriate block in the service you are creating

1. Connect the `SubscribeShake` block to the `GetAccelData` block
1. Connect the `GetAccelData` block to the `PublishFan` block

##### Save the `Lab2` service
1. Click the down arrow next to the `Lab2` label at the top of the screen
1. Click `save`

##### Your service should look similar to:
![](./img/instructions/lab2.png)

##### Start the `Lab2` service
1. Click the down arrow next to the `Lab2` label at the top of the screen
1. Click `start`

##### Now to turn the fan on/off...
1. Using your mobile phone browser, connect to `https://nio.school/mobiletest` again if you have left the page (allowing n.io to again access your location)
1. Enter a name and email if necessary
1. Shake your phone to trigger movement of the accelerometer
1. Once the signal has been transmitted through the web socket, the fan should turn on
1. Shake your phone again to turn the fan off
1. Scroll to the top of this page to see the state of the fan with a graph of your accelerometer data:<br><br>

##### Congratulations you have successfully created your first n.io service!!
